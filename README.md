Data Analyst | Python Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner
---------------------------------------------------

Hi, I‚Äôm Hassan, and I‚Äôm from Northwest London. I‚Äôm currently completing a data technician bootcamp where I‚Äôm gaining hands-on experience with data analysis, SQL, Python, and Excel. One thing that sets me apart is my strong technical foundation‚Äîbefore this bootcamp, I earned an IT qualification with a D*D*D, and during college, I developed a website as part of a software development project. This combination of IT knowledge and real-world coding experience has shaped my ability to problem-solve and think analytically. <br><br>What makes me particularly excited about the data field is how data is becoming increasingly essential in every industry. As we move toward a data-driven future, I‚Äôm motivated to continuously evolve, and my goal is to deepen my coding skills, especially in Python‚Äîso I can integrate them directly into data roles. This bootcamp has already introduced me to key data technician roles, including data management, cleaning, and visualization, and I‚Äôm eager to continue building a portfolio that showcases my growing experience and technical expertise.
